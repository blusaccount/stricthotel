# Agent Instructions

Read [LLM_AGENT_GUIDE.md](LLM_AGENT_GUIDE.md) first.

## ExecPlans
When a task is large, risky, or spans multiple files, create an ExecPlan using [PLANS.md](PLANS.md). Keep it short and update it as you work.

## Scope discipline
- Implement exactly what the user asks.
- Avoid adding adjacent features without confirmation.
- Prefer existing patterns and helpers.

## Handoff
Record changes and verification notes in [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md).
