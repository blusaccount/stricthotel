Ensure the Discord bot and yt-dlp work in Docker builds without breaking existing workflows.

## Scope
In scope: Dockerfile and .dockerignore adjustments for bot runtime and security hardening.
Out of scope: bot feature changes, game logic, or non-Docker deployment changes.

## Context
- `Dockerfile` build steps and runtime user
- `.dockerignore` image size and sensitive artifacts
- `bot/scripts/setup.js` postinstall downloader

## Plan of Work
1. Ensure postinstall can run during Docker build (copy bot scripts early, allow scripts).
2. Install curl in the image for yt-dlp download.
3. Run container as a non-root user.
4. Exclude platform binaries from Docker context.
5. Update handoff notes.

## Progress
- [x] Start plan

## ExecPlan - PR #1 Self-hosting Baseline

## Purpose
Add a non-disruptive Docker-based quickstart so community owners can run StrictHotel with copy/paste setup.

## Scope
In scope: containerization docs and env template improvements.
Out of scope: game logic, socket behavior, licensing logic.

## Context
- `server.js`, `server/index.js` start path
- `README.md` onboarding docs
- `.env.example` runtime configuration sample

## Plan of Work
1. Add `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` with a production-safe Node runtime.
2. Add `docker-compose.yml` for one-command local bring-up.
3. Expand `.env.example` with clear required/optional keys while keeping backward compatibility.
4. Update `README.md` with docker quickstart and troubleshooting notes.
5. Run basic verification commands.

## Progress
- [x] Start plan
- [x] Implement changes
- [x] Verify behavior
- [x] Update handoff notes

## Surprises and Discoveries
- Existing runtime already exposes `/health`, making container health checks straightforward.

## Decision Log
- Decision: Keep `DISCORD_TOKEN` as primary env var and document `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` as optional alias for future compatibility.
  Rationale: Avoid disrupting current bot startup logic in `server/discord-bot.js`.
  Date: 2026-02-08

## Verification
- `docker compose config`
- `npm test`

## Outcomes
Shipped non-disruptive containerization assets and updated setup docs.
Verification was attempted; docker is unavailable in this environment and `vitest` is missing, so runtime checks are documented as environment-limited warnings.

## ExecPlan - Loop Machine Variable Bars (1-8)

## Purpose
Allow Loop Machine users to customize pattern length from 1 to 8 bars instead of fixed 4 bars.

## Scope
In scope: loop-machine client/server state, controls, and validation for bars.

## Context
- `server/socket-handlers.js`
- `games/loop-machine/js/game.js`
- `games/loop-machine/index.html`

## Plan of Work
1. Add shared loop bar limits and dynamic row sizing on the server.
2. Add bars control + dynamic rendering/playback on the client.
3. Verify with syntax checks and manual UI screenshot.
## ExecPlan - LoL Bet Resolution Reliability

## Purpose
Reduce false "No new match found" outcomes and transient Riot API failures that block LoL bet resolution.

## Scope
In scope: Riot API retry/backoff for transient upstream errors, broader match-history lookup for bet checks, targeted tests.
Out of scope: new admin tooling or UI redesign.

## Context
- `server/riot-api.js`
- `server/lol-match-checker.js`
- `server/__tests__/lol-match-checker.test.js`

## Plan of Work
1. Add bounded retry/backoff for transient Riot API failures (5xx/network).
2. Increase match-history depth used by background/manual bet checks.
3. Add tests for baseline-not-in-window/manual resolution behavior.
4. Update handoff notes.

## Progress
- [x] Start plan
- [x] Implement changes
- [x] Verify behavior
- [x] Update handoff notes

## Surprises and Discoveries
- None.

## Decision Log
- Decision: Keep 4 steps per bar and only make bar count configurable.
  Rationale: Minimal change that matches current sequencer feel while adding requested flexibility.
  Date: 2026-02-08

## Verification
- `node --check server/socket-handlers.js`
- `node --check games/loop-machine/js/game.js`
- Manual UI check + screenshot of bars control.

## Outcomes
Shipped variable bars (1-8) for Loop Machine across server sync, client playback/rendering, and controls.
Automated checks passed via syntax validation; full runtime/manual verification is blocked here by missing local dependencies.
- None yet.

## Decision Log
- Decision: Retry only transient failures (network + 5xx), not auth/rate-limit errors.
  Rationale: avoids masking configuration errors while improving reliability.
  Date: 2026-02-08

## Verification
- `npm test -- server/__tests__/lol-match-checker.test.js`

## Outcomes
Shipped with an additional follow-up: per-bet match selection with timestamp-aware scanning when baseline is outside the history window.

## ExecPlan - LoL Bet Resolution Stuck Bets

## Purpose
Ensure LoL bets resolve reliably by selecting the correct "next match" and making Riot account lookup resilient to transient 5xx errors.

## Scope
In scope: match-selection logic for multi-match gaps, Riot account lookup retries, targeted tests.
Out of scope: new admin tooling, UI changes, or major refactors.

## Context
- `server/lol-match-checker.js`
- `server/riot-api.js`
- `server/__tests__/lol-match-checker.test.js`

## Plan of Work
1. Adjust match selection to pick the first match after the baseline (not the most recent).
2. Add retry/backoff to Riot account lookups for transient failures.
3. Update tests to cover multi-match gaps.
4. Update handoff notes.

## Progress

## ExecPlan - Socket Handlers Refactor

## Purpose
Split the monolithic `server/socket-handlers.js` (~2269 lines / ~108 KB) into domain-specific handler modules while maintaining 100% behavior compatibility. This addresses the biggest maintenance burden in the codebase.

## Scope
In scope: structural refactor of socket-handlers.js into separate modules by feature domain.
Out of scope: behavior changes, new features, gameplay modifications, fixing pre-existing test failures.

## Context
- `server/socket-handlers.js` (main file to refactor)
- `server/handlers/` (new directory for handler modules)
- All existing socket handler tests in `server/__tests__/`

## Plan of Work
1. Create `server/handlers/` directory structure
2. Extract each domain into its own handler module:
   - lobby.js - player registration, room management, chat, emotes
   - maexchen.js - Mäxchen game handlers
   - brain-versus.js - StrictBrain game and leaderboards
   - stocks.js - stock trading and portfolio
   - lol-betting.js - LoL betting and match checking
   - pictochat.js - drawing and canvas handlers
   - soundboard.js - soundboard handlers
   - currency.js - balance, diamonds, make-it-rain, shop
   - strict-club.js - music player handlers
   - loop-machine.js - loop machine handlers
   - strictly7s.js - slot machine handlers
   - watchparty.js - watch party video sync
3. Create shared deps object with utilities and state
4. Consolidate disconnect handlers into cleanup functions
5. Refactor socket-handlers.js into thin orchestrator
6. Validate all modules with syntax checks
7. Run full test suite (must maintain 159/162 passing)

## Progress
- [x] Read HANDOFF.md and understand recent changes
- [x] Analyze current socket-handlers.js structure
- [x] Create execution plan
- [x] Create handlers directory
- [ ] Create individual handler modules (in progress)
- [ ] Refactor socket-handlers.js orchestrator
- [ ] Syntax validation
- [ ] Run tests
- [ ] Update HANDOFF.md

## Surprises and Discoveries
- File contains 2269 lines with handlers for 12+ different domains
- 3 pre-existing test failures in lol-betting and lol-match-checker (not in scope to fix)
- Disconnect handler has complex multi-domain cleanup logic
- Rate limiting uses both socket-level and IP-level tracking

## Decision Log
- Decision: Keep rate limiting and cooldown logic in socket-handlers.js
  Rationale: Shared state accessed by orchestrator, not domain-specific
  Date: 2026-02-08

- Decision: Pass deps object to each handler registration function
  Rationale: Allows handlers to access shared utilities without circular imports
  Date: 2026-02-08

- Decision: Create per-domain cleanup functions for disconnect handler
  Rationale: Keeps disconnect handler maintainable while preserving all cleanup logic
  Date: 2026-02-08

## Verification
- `node --check server/socket-handlers.js`
- `node --check` on all handler modules in `server/handlers/`
- `npm test` - must show 159/162 passing (3 pre-existing failures)
- Manual review of file sizes (socket-handlers.js should be < 500 lines)

## Outcomes
- Pending.
