# Handoff: Strictly7s V2 – Full Upgrade (2026-02-09)

## What Changed

Comprehensive upgrade of the Strictly7s slot machine game covering critical bugfixes, comprehensive tests, client modernization, and UX improvements.

### Files Modified

**Server-side:**
- `server/handlers/strictly7s.js`
  - Fixed RTP from ~100% to 92.31% by adjusting symbol weights and multipliers
  - Added detailed RTP calculation comments with exact math (target: 90-93%)
  - Fixed cherry evaluation to check for exactly 2 cherries (not >=2)
  - Exported test helpers: `pickStrictly7sSymbol`, `evaluateStrictly7sSpin`, `STRICTLY7S_SYMBOLS`, `STRICTLY7S_TOTAL_WEIGHT`
  - New multipliers: SEVEN 148x, BAR 53x, DIAMOND 31x, BELL 18x, CHERRY 10x, LEMON 7x

**Tests:**
- `server/__tests__/strictly7s.test.js` (NEW)
  - 24 comprehensive tests covering symbol picking, spin evaluation, and edge cases
  - RTP simulation test (1M spins) confirming 92.56% actual RTP within target range

**Client-side:**
- `games/strictly7s/js/game.js`
  - Modernized to ES6+ syntax (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
  - Fixed race condition between spin-result and error handlers using `pendingResultTimer`
  - Added balance tracking and bet button state management
  - Added win/loss/jackpot animations
  - Added last 5 spins history tracking and rendering
  - Maintained IIFE pattern for script tag compatibility

- `games/strictly7s/index.html`
  - Updated payout table to reflect new multipliers
  - Added CSS for win/loss/jackpot animations (@keyframes winPulse, jackpotPulse, lossFade)
  - Added `.insufficient` bet button styling (opacity: 0.4, pointer-events: none)
  - Added spin history HTML container with styling

## What Didn't Change

- Server-side socket handler structure and validation logic
- STRICTLY7S_BETS array ([2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50])
- Overall game flow and socket event contracts
- No new dependencies added

## How to Verify

1. **Tests:** `npm test` — All 184 tests pass (RTP simulation confirms 92-93% target)
2. **Manual gameplay:**
   - Visit `/games/strictly7s/`
   - Verify balance-aware bet buttons (insufficient bets are disabled)
   - Place spins and verify:
     - Win animations (green pulse for wins, gold pulse for 3x SEVEN)
     - Loss animations (dim effect)
     - Spin history shows last 5 results
     - Payouts match new multiplier table
3. **Edge cases:**
   - Verify 2x cherry pays 2x (not 3x cherry which pays 10x)
   - Verify race condition is fixed (error after spin-result doesn't corrupt UI)

## Technical Details

**RTP Calculation (92.31% target):**
- Total weight: 28
- Three-of-a-kind EVs: SEVEN 0.67%, BAR 1.93%, DIAMOND 3.81%, BELL 10.25%, CHERRY 15.63%, LEMON 31.89%
- Two-cherry partial: 28.13%
- Total RTP: 92.31% (confirmed by simulation: 92.56%)
- House edge: 7.69%

**Security:**
- CodeQL scan: 0 alerts
- No new vulnerabilities introduced
- All validation logic preserved

## Notes

- This is a major upgrade but maintains backward compatibility
- ES6+ modernization improves code maintainability without changing behavior
- RTP fix brings house edge in line with industry standards (7-8%)
- All UX improvements are non-breaking and enhance player experience
