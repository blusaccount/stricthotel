# Handoff: Fix Stale Ticker Prices in Partial API Responses (2026-02-09)

## What Changed

### Bug: Portfolios show zero gain/loss despite open market

When Yahoo Finance's batch API returned partial results (some symbols missing from the response), `fetchTickerQuotes()` replaced the entire cache with only the symbols that were returned. This caused portfolio snapshots to fall back to `avgCost` for the missing symbols, showing zero gain/loss.

**Root cause:** In `server/routes/stocks.js`, the ticker cache was fully replaced on each successful batch fetch. If a batch returned 50 out of 55 symbols, the 5 missing ones lost their cached prices entirely.

**Fix:** `fetchTickerQuotes()` now merges new batch results with the existing cache. Symbols present in the new batch get updated prices; symbols missing from the batch retain their previously-cached prices.

### Improvement: Silent fetch failures now logged

`getQuoteForSymbol()` in `server/handlers/stocks.js` caught errors from individual Yahoo Finance lookups but silently returned `null`. This made it impossible to diagnose price fetch failures.

**Fix:** Added `console.error` logging in the catch block.

### Files Modified

- `server/routes/stocks.js` — Merge batch results with cached data instead of replacing
- `server/handlers/stocks.js` — Log errors in `getQuoteForSymbol` catch block
- `server/__tests__/stocks-route.test.js` — 5 new tests covering merge behavior

## What Didn't Change

- Buy/sell trade logic, price validation, rate limiting
- Ticker symbol list and cache durations
- Client-side code
- Database schema
- Portfolio snapshot logic in `stock-game.js`

## How to Verify

1. `npm test` — All 198 tests pass (193 original + 5 new)
2. Simulate a partial Yahoo Finance response (some symbols missing) and verify portfolio still shows price changes for previously-cached symbols
3. Check server logs for `[getQuoteForSymbol]` entries when individual lookups fail

# Handoff: Fix Stock Portfolio/Price Updates (2026-02-09)

## What Changed

Fixed two bugs that prevented stock portfolios and prices from updating.

### Bug 1: fetchTickerQuotes error handling
`fetchTickerQuotes()` in `server/routes/stocks.js` had no catch block. When the Yahoo Finance API failed, the error propagated to socket handlers which caught it silently and sent nothing to the client. The portfolio/leaderboard would never update during API outages.

**Fix:** Added a catch block that returns stale cached data (or empty array) instead of throwing.

### Bug 2: Non-ticker stock prices never update
Stocks bought via the search feature (not in the predefined TICKER_SYMBOLS list) never got updated prices. `fetchTickerQuotes()` only fetches prices for predefined symbols. When computing portfolio/leaderboard snapshots, non-ticker stocks fell back to `avgCost` as their current price, so their value never changed.

**Fix:** Added an optional `fetchMissingPrice` callback parameter to `getPortfolioSnapshot`, `getLeaderboardSnapshot`, and `getTradePerformanceLeaderboard`. The handlers pass a callback that uses `getQuoteForSymbol` to look up individual stock prices for symbols not in the ticker list. Results are cached in the price map to avoid duplicate lookups.

### Files Modified

- `server/routes/stocks.js` — Added catch block in `fetchTickerQuotes()` IIFE
- `server/stock-game.js` — Added optional `fetchMissingPrice` callback to `getPortfolioSnapshot`, `getLeaderboardSnapshot`, `getTradePerformanceLeaderboard`
- `server/handlers/stocks.js` — Pass `fetchMissingPrice` callback to all portfolio/leaderboard calls
- `server/__tests__/stock-game.test.js` — 7 new tests covering both fixes

## What Didn't Change

- Buy/sell trade logic, price validation, rate limiting
- Ticker symbol list and cache durations
- Client-side code
- Database schema

## How to Verify

1. `npm test` — All 193 tests pass (186 original + 7 new)
2. Buy a stock via search (non-ticker), verify portfolio shows updated price on refresh
3. Simulate Yahoo Finance API failure (e.g. network disconnect), verify portfolio still loads with cached prices

# Handoff: Fix LoL Betting Resolution (2026-02-09)

## What Changed

Fixed three bugs that prevented LoL bets from resolving correctly.

### Files Modified

**Server-side:**
- `server/lol-match-checker.js`
  - `resolveBetAndNotify` now returns the resolution result (or `null` on failure) instead of swallowing errors silently. This was the primary cause of bets appearing stuck: `manualCheckBetStatus` would tell the user the bet was resolved even when the underlying `resolveBet` call failed.
  - `manualCheckBetStatus` now checks the return value and reports `RESOLVE_FAILED` when resolution doesn't complete.
  - `selectResolvingMatchForBet` now picks the **oldest** match after bet placement (the player's "next game") instead of the newest. This ensures the bet resolves on the correct game.
  - `lol-bet-resolved` socket event now includes `betOnWin` so clients can display the correct game outcome.

**Client-side:**
- `games/lol-betting/js/game.js`
  - `showBetResolutionNotification` now correctly describes whether the LoL player won or lost their game, regardless of bet direction. Previously it always said "won their game" for winning bets and "lost their game" for losing bets, even when the bettor had bet on LOSE.

**Tests:**
- `server/__tests__/lol-match-checker.test.js`
  - Added test for `RESOLVE_FAILED` error when `resolveBet` returns null.
  - Added test verifying the oldest match after bet placement is selected (not the newest).

## What Didn't Change

- Bet placement flow, validation, and currency handling
- Timeout-based resolution logic (`resolveBetByTimeout`)
- Database schema
- Riot API integration
- Socket event names and overall contracts

## How to Verify

1. `npm test` — All 186 tests pass (184 original + 2 new)
2. Place a LoL bet, wait for the player to complete a game, then click "Check Status"
3. Verify the bet resolves on the player's first game after the bet was placed
4. If resolution fails (e.g. DB error), verify the user sees "Failed to resolve bet" instead of a false success

# Handoff: Codebase Cleanup (2026-02-09)
# Handoff: Strictly7s Visual Enhancement – Fix Centering Bug (2026-02-09)

## What Changed

Fixed critical symbol centering bug and significantly enhanced the visual design of the Strictly7s slot machine game. The game is now much more prominent and visually engaging.

### Files Modified

**Client-side:**
- `games/strictly7s/index.html`
  - Fixed centering bug: Removed flexbox centering from `.reel-window` (conflicts with transform positioning)
  - Increased reel dimensions: 96px → 160px height, 28px → 56px font size
  - Enlarged page width: 980px → 1400px for better screen utilization
  - Enhanced `.reels` container: Added box-shadow, increased padding and gaps
  - Added new animations: `reelGlow`, `titlePulse`, `paylinePulse` keyframes
  - Enhanced win/jackpot animations with scale transforms
  - Improved spin button with hover/active states and box-shadow
  - Updated media query breakpoint: 900px → 1100px
  
- `games/strictly7s/js/game.js`
  - Updated `REEL_HEIGHT` constant: 96 → 160 to match CSS changes

## What Didn't Change

- Server-side game logic and RTP calculations
- Socket event contracts and communication flow
- Symbol definitions and payout multipliers
- Existing animation triggers and timing
- Test suite (all 184 tests still pass)

## How to Verify

1. **Tests:** `npm test` — All 184 tests pass including RTP simulation
2. **Manual gameplay:**
   - Visit `/games/strictly7s/`
   - Verify symbols now center perfectly on the payline (not stuck at top)
   - Observe larger, more prominent reels and game layout
   - Notice enhanced animations:
     - Title pulses with golden glow
     - Payline pulses subtly
     - Reels glow during spin
     - Win/jackpot animations scale reels
     - Spin button has hover effects
3. **Visual comparison:**
   - Before: Symbols misaligned at top, game small and cramped
   - After: Symbols perfectly centered, game large and prominent

## Technical Details

**Centering Bug Fix:**
- Root cause: Flexbox `align-items: center` on `.reel-window` conflicted with `transform: translateY()` on `.reel-strip`
- Solution: Removed flexbox centering, made `.reel-window` use `position: relative` only
- Result: Transform positioning now works correctly, symbols land at exact center

**Visual Enhancements:**
- Reel size increase: 67% larger (96px → 160px)
- Page width increase: 43% wider (980px → 1400px)
- Font size increase: 100% larger (28px → 56px)
- New glow effects on spinning reels
- Pulsing animations on title and payline
- Enhanced win feedback with scale transforms

**Security:**
- CodeQL scan: 0 alerts
- No new vulnerabilities introduced
- All changes are CSS/visual only (no logic changes)

## Notes

- This is a pure visual enhancement that maintains full backward compatibility
- No changes to game logic, RTP, or payout behavior
- Significantly improves user experience with better visibility and feedback
- The centering bug was preventing symbols from landing on the payline properly
