# HANDOFF - Code Review Fixes

## What Was Done

### Bugfixes

**WatchParty: use game-started payload** (`games/watchparty/js/watchparty.js`)
- `game-started` handler now receives a `data` parameter
- Player bar renders immediately from payload (instead of staying empty until the next room-update)

**WatchParty: host change sync** (`games/watchparty/js/watchparty.js`)
- On `room-update`, checks if the host changed (`wasHost` vs `isHost`)
- New host automatically starts the sync interval

**Maexchen join limit fixed** (`server/socket-handlers.js`)
- Was: Watchparty 6, Maexchen 4, while UI said "2-6 players"
- Now: unified max 6 players for all game types

**Pictochat resize** (`public/pictochat.js`)
- Added `window.addEventListener('resize', resizeCanvas)`
- Canvas re-renders on window resize

**XSS escaping in lobby** (`shared/js/lobby.js`)
- Added `escapeHtml()` helper
- `renderOnlinePlayers`: `p.name` and `p.character.dataURL` are escaped
- `renderLobbies`: `lobby.hostName` and `lobby.code` are escaped

### Refactoring

**removePlayerFromRoom helper** (`server/room-manager.js`)
- Extracted new function `removePlayerFromRoom(io, socketId, room)`
- Includes all leave logic: game-state cleanup (WatchParty + Maexchen), player removal, host reassignment, room deletion, broadcasts
- `leave-room` handler reduced from ~75 lines to 4
- `disconnect` handler reduced from ~70 lines to ~10
- Eliminated ~120 lines of duplicated code

**socketToRoom lookup map** (`server/room-manager.js`)
- New `Map<socketId, roomCode>` for O(1) room lookup
- `getRoom()` now uses lookup instead of iterating all rooms
- Map maintained on create-room, join-room, removePlayerFromRoom, and cleanup interval
- Stale entries are automatically cleaned up

**.env.example completed**
- Added `CLIENT_ID` and `GUILD_ID` (previously only in `bot/.env.example`)

## Files Changed
- `server/room-manager.js` — socketToRoom map, removePlayerFromRoom helper, game-logic import
- `server/socket-handlers.js` — socketToRoom import + set on create/join, simplified leave/disconnect handlers, join limit fix
- `server/index.js` — socketToRoom import + cleanup
- `games/watchparty/js/watchparty.js` — game-started payload, host change sync
- `public/pictochat.js` — resize listener
- `shared/js/lobby.js` — escapeHtml helper + usage
- `.env.example` — CLIENT_ID, GUILD_ID

## Not Changed
- Game logic (game-logic.js unchanged)
- Discord bot
- Frontend HTML/CSS
- Pictochat server handlers (clear/cursor limits unchanged)

## Open Items
- CSS could be split into modules (theme.css is 2200 lines)
- `getOpenLobbies()` is still O(n) over all rooms (no index by gameType)
