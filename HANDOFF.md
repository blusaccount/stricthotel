# HANDOFF - Fix LoL Betting "Failed to place bet" Error

## What Was Done

### Bug Fix: Generic error message hiding actual failure reasons

Players placing LoL bets saw "Failed to place bet" with no indication of the root cause (e.g. player not found, invalid input, DB error). Three issues were addressed:

1. **Specific error messages**: The catch-all handler now surfaces known safe error messages (e.g. "Player not found", "Invalid bet amount") instead of always showing "Failed to place bet". Unknown/internal errors still show the generic message to avoid leaking implementation details.

2. **Missing game type**: `lol-betting` was not in the `validateGameType` allowed list. The regex also stripped hyphens, so `'lol-betting'` became `'lolbetting'` which didn't match anything and defaulted to `'maexchen'`. Fixed the regex to allow hyphens and added `'lol-betting'` to the allowed list.

3. **Silent rate-limit rejection**: When rate-limited, the `lol-validate-username` and `lol-place-bet` handlers returned silently with no feedback, leaving the client UI stuck in a loading state. Now emits appropriate error events so the client can reset.

## Files Changed

- `server/socket-handlers.js` — rate-limit feedback for `lol-validate-username` and `lol-place-bet`; specific error messages in `lol-place-bet` catch block
- `server/socket-utils.js` — allow hyphens in `validateGameType` regex; add `'lol-betting'` to allowed game types
- `server/__tests__/socket-utils.test.js` — test for `lol-betting` game type validation

## Verification

- `npm test` — all 122 tests pass
- `node --check server/socket-handlers.js && node --check server/socket-utils.js` — no syntax errors

# HANDOFF - Riot API Username Validation for LoL Betting

## What Was Done

### LoL Betting: Riot ID Validation via Riot Games API

Users must now enter a valid Riot ID (Name#Tag format) when placing LoL bets. The username is validated against the Riot Games Account API before a bet is accepted.

**New file: `server/riot-api.js`**
- `parseRiotId(riotId)` — parses "Name#Tag" into gameName + tagLine
- `isRiotApiEnabled()` — checks if `RIOT_API_KEY` env var is set
- `lookupRiotAccount(gameName, tagLine)` — calls Riot Account v1 API
- `validateRiotId(riotId)` — end-to-end validation (parse + API lookup)
- Graceful degradation: accepts well-formatted IDs when API key is missing

**Server changes: `server/socket-handlers.js`**
- New socket event `lol-validate-username` — validates Riot ID and returns result
- Updated `lol-place-bet` — validates Riot ID via API before accepting bet; uses canonical name from API response

**Client changes: `games/lol-betting/`**
- Input now expects Riot ID format (Name#Tag) with placeholder "e.g. Player#EUW"
- Added SEARCH button next to input to validate before submitting
- Validation status indicator (green checkmark or red X with reason)
- PLACE BET button requires validated username
- Re-editing the username field resets validation

**Config: `.env.example`**
- Added `RIOT_API_KEY` and `RIOT_REGION` environment variables

**Tests: `server/__tests__/riot-api.test.js`**
- 13 tests covering `parseRiotId` — valid formats, edge cases, invalid inputs

## Files Changed
- `server/riot-api.js` (new)
- `server/__tests__/riot-api.test.js` (new)
- `server/socket-handlers.js`
- `games/lol-betting/index.html`
- `games/lol-betting/js/game.js`
- `.env.example`

## Verification
- All 71 tests pass (`npm test`)
- Server starts, LoL betting page renders correctly
- SEARCH button enables only when input matches Name#Tag format
- Validation status displays correctly (green/red)
- PLACE BET disabled until username is validated
- Without `RIOT_API_KEY`, accepts any well-formatted Riot ID (graceful degradation)

# HANDOFF - Compact Main Menu Layout

## What Was Done

### UI Change: Compact Game Cards in Main Menu

**Game card layout** (`public/index.html`)
- Changed game cards from vertical (stacked) to horizontal (icon left, text right)
- Wrapped text content in `.game-card-info` div for flex layout
- Reduced card padding (30px → 12px), icon size (4rem → 2rem), font sizes
- Grid now uses fixed 2-column layout instead of auto-fit with 280px minimum
- Description text clamped to 2 lines with overflow hidden
- Updated mobile breakpoints to match compact sizing
- Border reduced from 2px to 1px; hover effects scaled down proportionally

## Files Changed
- `public/index.html` — CSS and HTML for compact game card layout

## Verification
- Server starts, page renders correctly
- Game cards display in compact 2-column grid with horizontal layout
- All game links still work
- Mobile responsive breakpoints preserved
- CodeQL: 0 alerts

# HANDOFF - Mäxchen Betting Feature

## What Was Done

### New Feature: Mäxchen Betting

**Betting UI in waiting room** (`games/maexchen/index.html`)
- Added betting section with coin input, "Setzen" button, balance display, and bet list
- Shows all placed bets in real-time

**Server-side betting logic** (`server/socket-handlers.js`)
- New `place-bet` socket event with validation (balance check, integer check, range 0-1000, rate limiting)
- Imported `addBalance` and `deductBalance` from currency.js
- On `start-game`: deducts bets from all players, builds pot, stores in game state
- On `game-over` (challenge path): awards pot to winner, sends balance updates
- On `game-over` (believe-maexchen path): same pot distribution
- Broadcasts `bets-update` to room when any player places a bet

**Pot distribution on disconnect** (`server/room-manager.js`)
- Imported `addBalance` and `getBalance` from currency.js
- On disconnect game-over: awards pot to winner, sends balance updates

**Client-side game logic** (`games/maexchen/js/game.js`)
- Handles `balance-update` to track player balance
- Handles `bets-update` to render bet list in waiting room
- Emits `place-bet` on button click with client-side validation
- Shows pot display during active game
- Shows winnings amount on game-over screen
- Requests balance on load via `get-balance`

**Styling** (`shared/css/theme.css`)
- `.bet-section` — gold-bordered container for betting UI
- `.bet-row` — flex row with input, label, button
- `.bet-entry` — individual bet display in list
- `.pot-display` — in-game pot indicator
- `.pot-winnings` — animated gold text for winner's earnings

## Files Changed
- `server/socket-handlers.js` — place-bet handler, pot in game state, pot distribution on game-over
- `server/room-manager.js` — currency imports, pot distribution on disconnect game-over
- `games/maexchen/index.html` — betting section in waiting room, pot display in game/gameover screens
- `games/maexchen/js/game.js` — betting client logic, pot display, winnings display
- `shared/css/theme.css` — betting and pot styles

## Not Changed
- `server/currency.js` — already had all needed functions
- `server/game-logic.js` — no changes needed
- Discord bot, other games, shared JS modules

## Verification
- Server starts without errors, all modules import correctly
- Betting UI renders in waiting room with balance display
- Placing a bet updates the bet list in real-time
- CodeQL: 0 alerts

## Open Items
- Balances are in-memory only (no persistence across server restarts)
- CSS could be split into modules (theme.css is now ~2300 lines)

# HANDOFF - Persistence Direction (Wallet + Leaderboards)

## What Was Done

- Added `docs/persistence-plan.md` with a fresh-start persistence strategy tailored for Render free tier.
- Documented a recommended Postgres schema for:
  - `players` (wallet balance)
  - `stock_positions` (portfolio holdings)
  - `wallet_ledger` (auditable balance changes)
- Added a rollout checklist and post-deploy verification steps.

## Why

- Current wallet and stock leaderboard data are in-memory and are lost on process restart.
- Since there are no users yet, a clean cutover can be done without migration complexity.

## Files Changed

- `docs/persistence-plan.md`
- `HANDOFF.md`

## Verification

- Document review only.

## Update - Free-tier cost clarification

- Clarified in `docs/persistence-plan.md` that this persistence approach can be implemented with $0 using common free tiers (Render free + Neon/Supabase free Postgres).
- Added caveats about free-tier limits and scaling later without schema redesign.

---

# HANDOFF - Neon Persistence Implementation (Wallet + Stocks)

## What Was Done

- Added Postgres connectivity module in `server/db.js` with pooled queries and transaction helper.
- Added SQL schema file `server/sql/persistence.sql` for `players`, `stock_positions`, and `wallet_ledger`.
- Refactored `server/currency.js` to async DB-backed balance operations with ledger writes.
- Refactored `server/stock-game.js` to async DB-backed portfolio operations with transactional buy/sell.
- Updated socket handlers to await async persistence calls for:
  - registration/get-balance
  - stock buy/sell/portfolio/leaderboard
  - Mäxchen betting and pot payouts
  - StrictBrain coin rewards
  - leave/disconnect room cleanup path
- Updated room manager pot payout path to async balance updates.
- Added `pg` dependency in `package.json`.

## Important Notes

- A local fallback remains for dev if `DATABASE_URL` is not configured.
- `npm i pg` failed in this execution environment with `403 Forbidden` from npm registry, so lockfile refresh could not be completed here.

## Files Changed

- `server/db.js`
- `server/sql/persistence.sql`
- `server/currency.js`
- `server/stock-game.js`
- `server/socket-handlers.js`
- `server/room-manager.js`
- `package.json`

## Verification

- `node --check server/socket-handlers.js`
- `node --check server/room-manager.js`
- `node --check server/currency.js`
- `node --check server/stock-game.js`
- `node --check server/db.js`
- Local `node server.js` start check in this environment is blocked by missing installed dependencies (e.g. `yahoo-finance2`), so runtime validation here is limited to syntax checks.

# HANDOFF - Pictochat Persistence

## What Was Done

- Added DB-backed persistence for pictochat strokes and messages so state survives server restarts.
- Created `server/pictochat-store.js` with load/save/delete/clear helpers for both strokes and messages.
- Extended `server/sql/persistence.sql` with `picto_strokes` and `picto_messages` tables.
- Updated all pictochat socket handlers in `server/socket-handlers.js` to persist state asynchronously after broadcasting.
- On first `picto-join`, server hydrates in-memory state from DB if it is empty (lazy load).
- Updated client `public/pictochat.js` to replay persisted messages on join via the `picto-state` event.
- In-memory fallback is preserved for local dev without `DATABASE_URL`.

## Files Changed

- `server/sql/persistence.sql` — added `picto_strokes` and `picto_messages` tables
- `server/pictochat-store.js` — new module for pictochat DB operations
- `server/socket-handlers.js` — import store, hydrate on join, persist on stroke/shape/undo/redo/clear/message
- `public/pictochat.js` — replay persisted messages on join

## Verification

- `node --check server/pictochat-store.js`
- `node --check server/socket-handlers.js`
- After deploying: draw strokes and send messages, restart server, verify state is restored on rejoin.
- Schema must be applied to the database (`picto_strokes`, `picto_messages` tables).

# HANDOFF - Strict Brain Mascot (Prof. Dr. Strict)

## What Was Done

- Replaced the emoji professor placeholder in Strict Brain with a dedicated mascot image (`Prof. Dr. Strict`) on all relevant screens.
- Added a new SVG mascot asset at `games/strictbrain/assets/prof-dr-strict.svg`.

## Files Changed

- `games/strictbrain/index.html`
- `games/strictbrain/assets/prof-dr-strict.svg`
- `HANDOFF.md`

## Verification

- Confirmed markup updates for all professor slots in Strict Brain menu/training/versus/results screens.
- Attempted to run server for visual verification, but startup is blocked in this environment due to a missing dependency (`yahoo-finance2`).
# HANDOFF - Code Review Fixes (Round 1)

## What Was Done

### Bug Fixes & Cleanup across 7 files

- **`userinput/switch.mp3`** — renamed from `switch.mp3.mp3` (double extension bug)
- **`public/index.html`**, **`games/maexchen/index.html`**, **`games/watchparty/index.html`**, **`games/stocks/index.html`** — switch sound path fixed (`switch.mp3.mp3` -> `switch.mp3`), added `preload = 'auto'`, try/catch error handling, reduced timeout 300ms -> 250ms
- **`public/nostalgiabait/index.html`** — replaced per-frame `getImageData()`/`putImageData()` pixel noise loop with pre-rendered 128x128 noise texture pattern (major canvas performance improvement)
- **`server/socket-handlers.js`** — removed unused `ALLOWED_STOCK_SYMBOLS` Set (10 lines dead code)
- **`public/index.html`** — refactored 60+ `!important` declarations to `body .selector` scoping for CSS specificity; removed dead `game-desc` and `game-players` HTML divs (4 each) and their CSS rules

## Files Changed
- `userinput/switch.mp3` (renamed from `switch.mp3.mp3`)
- `public/index.html`
- `games/maexchen/index.html`
- `games/watchparty/index.html`
- `games/stocks/index.html`
- `public/nostalgiabait/index.html`

# HANDOFF - Strict Brain Code Review Fixes

## What Was Done

### Security Fix: Server-side coin calculation
- Server no longer trusts client-sent `coins` values in `brain-submit-score` and `brain-training-score`
- Added `calculateBrainCoins(brainAge)` and `calculateTrainingCoins(score)` server functions
- Coin formula: brainAge <=25 -> 50SC, <=35 -> 30SC, <=45 -> 20SC, <=55 -> 10SC, >55 -> 5SC
- Training coins: half of daily test coins, minimum 2SC

### Bug Fix: Disconnect forfeit for brain versus
- When a player disconnects during a versus game, opponent now receives win + 20 coins
- Previously, generic `removePlayerFromRoom()` was called which knew nothing about brain versus forfeit logic

### Bug Fix: Versus reaction score display
- Changed from sending round count (1, 2, 3...) to running average reaction time in ms
- Now shows meaningful live comparison between players

### Bug Fix: Switch sound on home button
- Added switch sound + 250ms delay to brain home button (consistent with all other games)

### Bug Fix: Invalid German word in scramble
- Replaced `'HAUSE'` (not a standalone word) with `'HAFEN'` in word scramble

### Cleanup: Code deduplication
- `SCRAMBLE_WORDS` array (51 words) defined once at top, was duplicated in single + versus
- `GAME_NAMES` and `GAME_TAB_NAMES` (identical maps) merged into single `GAME_NAMES`
- `scrambleWord()` function defined once at top, was duplicated in single + versus

## Files Changed
- `server/socket-handlers.js` — server coin calc, disconnect forfeit
- `games/strictbrain/js/game.js` — reaction score, word fix, deduplication
- `games/strictbrain/index.html` — switch sound on home button

## Verification
- All 31 tests pass (`npm test`)
- Brain daily test: coins awarded match server-side calculation
- Versus disconnect: opponent gets forfeit win + 20 coins
- Home button: switch sound plays on click

## Open Items

### Resolved
- ~~CSS could be split into modules (theme.css is now ~2500 lines)~~ — Won't fix. No bundler in project, splitting would add multiple HTTP requests. File is well-sectioned with comment headers. Strict Brain + Stocks already use inline CSS.
- ~~`npm i pg` failed in Copilot environment~~ — Resolved. `pg` is in both `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

### Remaining
- **~600 lines code duplication in `games/strictbrain/js/game.js`** — Each of 5 mini-games is fully duplicated for single-player and versus mode. Only difference: target DOM element IDs and score update callbacks. Works correctly but is a maintenance burden. Future refactor could parameterize game functions with `{ area, onScore, onFinish }` config objects.

# HANDOFF - Portfolio Performance Chart

## What Was Done

### New Feature: Portfolio Performance Graph in Stock Game

- Added a line chart showing the user's portfolio value, cash, and net worth over time.
- Chart uses Chart.js (loaded via CDN, no build step) and matches the existing Nintendo DS pixel theme.
- Portfolio snapshots are recorded in-memory on the server whenever portfolio data is fetched (on buy, sell, or periodic refresh).
- New socket event `stock-get-portfolio-history` serves snapshot history to the client.
- Chart shows three lines: Net Worth (solid), Portfolio Value (dashed), and Cash (dashed).
- When fewer than 2 data points exist, a placeholder message is shown instead of the chart.
- History resets on server restart (in-memory only, capped at 100 snapshots per player).

## Files Changed

- `server/portfolio-history.js` — new module for recording and retrieving portfolio snapshots
- `server/socket-handlers.js` — import portfolio-history, record snapshots after buy/sell/get-portfolio, add `stock-get-portfolio-history` handler
- `games/stocks/index.html` — Chart.js CDN, chart container HTML, chart CSS styles
- `games/stocks/js/game.js` — chart rendering logic, socket handler for history data, periodic history fetch
- `server/__tests__/portfolio-history.test.js` — unit tests for the portfolio-history module

## Verification

- `node --check server/portfolio-history.js`
- `node --check server/socket-handlers.js`
- `npm test` (58 tests pass, including 4 new portfolio-history tests)
- Manual: server starts, stocks page loads with chart section visible

# HANDOFF - Currency System Resilience (LoL Betting)

## What Was Done

### Bug Fix: Currency deducted even when bet placement fails

When a player placed a LoL bet, the currency was deducted first (`deductBalance`) and then the bet was created (`placeBet`). If `placeBet` threw an error, the catch block only emitted an error message — it never refunded the deducted currency. This caused permanent currency loss on failed bets.

### Changes

**`server/currency.js`**
- `addBalance` and `deductBalance` now wrap the balance update + ledger insert in a database transaction when no external client is provided. This prevents the balance from changing without a corresponding ledger entry.
- Extracted `_addBalanceDB` and `_deductBalanceDB` helpers to keep the logic DRY when used with or without an external transaction client.

**`server/lol-betting.js`**
- `placeBet` now accepts an optional `client` parameter so it can participate in an external database transaction.

**`server/socket-handlers.js`**
- The `lol-place-bet` handler now uses `withTransaction` (DB mode) to atomically deduct the balance and place the bet. If either step fails, the entire transaction rolls back — no currency is lost.
- In-memory mode: if `placeBet` throws after `deductBalance` succeeds, the handler refunds the deducted amount via `addBalance` before re-throwing.

**`server/__tests__/currency.test.js`**
- Added "deduct + refund resilience" tests verifying balance restoration after a failed downstream operation and that balance stays unchanged when deduction itself fails.

**`server/__tests__/lol-betting.test.js`** (new)
- Unit tests for `placeBet`, `getActiveBets`, and `getPlayerBets` in in-memory mode.
- Verifies the optional `client` parameter is accepted without error.

## Verification

- `npm test` (86 tests pass — 79 original + 7 new)
- `node --check server/currency.js`
- `node --check server/lol-betting.js`
- `node --check server/socket-handlers.js`

# HANDOFF - Pictochat Undo/Redo/Clear Fixes

## What Was Done

### Bug Fix: Undo/redo/clear not working in pictochat

Three client-side bugs in `public/pictochat.js` prevented undo, redo, and clear from working correctly:

1. **Shapes not undoable**: The `picto-shape` client handler applied shapes to the canvas but never added their `strokeId` to the `undoStack`. This meant shapes (line, rect, circle) could never be undone or redone. Fixed by updating the handler to push to `undoStack` and clear `redoStack` when the shape was authored by the current user (matching the `picto-stroke-commit` pattern).

2. **Clear left stale undo/redo stacks for other users**: The `picto-clear` handler only cleared `undoStack` and `redoStack` for the user who initiated the clear (`data.byId === socket.id`). Other users retained stale stroke IDs in their stacks, causing silent failures on subsequent undo/redo attempts. Fixed by clearing both stacks unconditionally for all users on clear.

3. **Reconnect left stale undo/redo stacks**: The `picto-state` handler (fired on join/reconnect) reset the `strokes` array but did not reset `undoStack` and `redoStack`. After reconnecting, the user could have stale entries. Fixed by clearing both stacks when new state is received.

## Files Changed

- `public/pictochat.js`

## Verification

- `npm test` (86 tests pass, no regressions)
- Server-side handlers are unchanged; all fixes are client-only

# HANDOFF - Fix LoL Bet Placement Failure

## What Was Done

### Bug Fix: Bet placement failing after successful username validation

The `lol-place-bet` socket handler was making a redundant Riot API call (`validateRiotId()`) to re-validate the Riot ID, even though it was already validated in the separate `lol-validate-username` step. This second API call could fail due to rate limiting (the same account was just looked up moments earlier), causing bet placement to fail with "Failed to place bet" despite the username showing as valid.

**Fix: Remove redundant API call** — Replaced `validateRiotId()` (full API lookup) with `parseRiotId()` (format-only validation) in the `lol-place-bet` handler. The Riot API validation already happened in `lol-validate-username` and doesn't need to be repeated.

## Files Changed

- `server/socket-handlers.js` — import `parseRiotId`, replace API call with format validation in `lol-place-bet`
- `server/__tests__/lol-betting.test.js` — additional tests for incrementing IDs, sort order, and limit

## Verification

- `npm test` — all tests pass
- CodeQL: 0 alerts

# HANDOFF - Comprehensive Code Review Fixes

## What Was Done

Performed a full-codebase review covering security, correctness, performance, and test coverage.

### Security Fixes

1. **LoL Betting Input Validation** (`server/lol-betting.js`)
   - `placeBet()` now validates `playerName`, `lolUsername`, `amount`, and `betOnWin` types before processing
   - `getPlayerBets()` limit parameter is now sanitized (clamped 1–100, floored to integer)

2. **Chat Message XSS** (`server/socket-handlers.js`)
   - `chat-message` handler now strips `"`, `'`, and backtick characters (matching `picto-message` sanitization)

3. **Brain Leaderboard Validation** (`server/brain-leaderboards.js`)
   - `updateBrainAgeLeaderboard()` and `updateGameLeaderboard()` now validate `playerName` type

4. **Portfolio History Guards** (`server/portfolio-history.js`)
   - `recordSnapshot()` rejects NaN/non-finite/non-string inputs before recording

### Database Schema Improvements (`server/sql/persistence.sql`)

- Added `CHECK (bet_amount > 0)` constraint on `lol_bets`
- Added `CHECK (shares > 0)` constraint on `stock_positions`
- Added index `lol_bets_player_name_idx` on `lol_bets(player_name)` for frequent lookups
- Added index `wallet_ledger_player_created_idx` on `wallet_ledger(player_id, created_at)` for daily reward queries

### Test Coverage

- New `server/__tests__/socket-utils.test.js` — 33 tests covering `sanitizeName`, `validateCharacter`, `validateRoomCode`, `validateGameType`, `validateYouTubeId`, `normalizePoint`, `sanitizeColor`, `sanitizeSize`, `getSocketIp`

## Files Changed

- `server/lol-betting.js` — input validation in `placeBet()`, safe limit in `getPlayerBets()`
- `server/socket-handlers.js` — chat-message XSS fix
- `server/brain-leaderboards.js` — playerName validation
- `server/portfolio-history.js` — NaN guards
- `server/sql/persistence.sql` — CHECK constraints and new indexes
- `server/__tests__/socket-utils.test.js` — new test file (33 tests)

## Verification

- `npm test` — 122 tests pass (89 original + 33 new)
- All existing tests remain green
